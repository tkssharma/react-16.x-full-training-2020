## How To Use This Guide
Use a **linear approach** to complete this guide. That means you should start with the first resource in the **[Essential Path](#essential-path)** and pass to the next one after you finish the previous and after make a practical project to internalize what you have learned.

The React's ecosystem is overwhelming for beginners. Ensure to learn each new tool **isolatedly**.

In the sections about React, Webpack, and ES2015+, the initial resources are more superficial and the last ones are going deeper in the respective topic. You can opt to learn the basics first and return to them later, but don't skip them without have a basic knowledge of the matter.

After you complete the *Essential Path*, you can choose one (or more) topics in the **[Optional Path](#optional-path)**. You do not need to go through this section in the same linear approach, you should choose new topics to learn based on your necessity and/or desire.

## How To Collaborate
To suggest new sections or new resources, open **one issue** for each resource/section explaining why we should add/remove such item. After at least 5 people approve (:+1:) your indication, you will be invited to create the pull request.

The reason to keep this way of collaboration is to ensure that our list of resources will be really concise, bringing only the best resources for those that want to master the topics listed here.
